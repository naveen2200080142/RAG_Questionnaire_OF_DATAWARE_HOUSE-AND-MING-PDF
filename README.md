This project demonstrates the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using Hugging Face APIs. 
The application processes a PDF containing knowledge about Data Warehousing and Data Mining to generate intelligent and relevant questions based on its content.
The primary objective of this project is to leverage the capabilities of Hugging Face APIs and combine them with textual data from a text PDF. 
This approach allows for the generation of context-aware, meaningful questions that can be used in educational or assessment contexts.
